With Go programming language you can use the final executable the same way on Windows, Linux and MacOS (by generating proper executable). 
But you cannot install this executable as a service using standard system tools like sc.exe, systemd or launchd. 
By using this approach you will know, how to make your software executable installable with those system tools and make it run as a service, when system starts.
its really simple have fun!!!
